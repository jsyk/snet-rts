Examples

A couple of examples is located in examples/tests/SAC


Box metadata in .snet source files
-----------------------------------

"SACmodule"
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Name of the SAC module library that contains the box function.

"SACboxfun"
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function name in the SAC module.

"SACdefaultmap"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default mapping of SAC bees (tasks) to LPEL workers.
Two possible formats:
    a) Comma separated list of worker IDs (integers).
        Example:
            <SACdefaultmap>-1, 2, 3, 0</SACdefaultmap>
        This assigns workers 2, 3, and 0 to SAC slave bees.
        The placement of the queen bee (the first integer) is determined
        by the snet system and cannot be influenced from within SAC, hence
        the value -1 should be always specified at the position.

    b) Name of an environment variable that will hold the list of worker IDs.
       The variable name starts by the '$' character.
        Example:
            <SACdefaultmap>$AMAP</SACdefaultmap>
        When the snet program starts it will look for the environment variable AMAP,
        and expect to find a list of worker IDs in it.
        So, the program may be executed like this:
            AMAP=-1,1,2 ./gigo_1-lpel <wkload-A00.xml
        The same note as above regarding the placement of the queen bee applies as well.


Diagnostics
--------------

*** SAC runtime warning
*** LPEL::SAC_MT_AllocHive: the mapping specification `places[0]' is not used, it shall be -1 to suppress the warning.

The "SACdefaultmap" metadata tag allows to specify the placement of SAC slave bees (tasks) onto the LPEL workers.
However, the SAC runtime cannot modify or influence the placement of the queen bee (that is, the "main" box task).
Therefore, the worker ID at the first position is unused in SAC and should be -1.
Most likely you have something like this:
    <SACdefaultmap>0, 1, 2</SACdefaultmap>
which incorrectly suggests that the queen bee will be placed on worker 0.
You have to change that to:
    <SACdefaultmap>-1, 1, 2</SACdefaultmap>
because you nor me don't know where the queen will be.


*** SAC runtime warning
*** In SAC4SNetFibreIO__PrintDoubleArray2: there was no hive attached to the calling thread!
    Created a temporary hive of one. The warning will not be repeated for this function.

The SAC printing function is called without an execution realm properly set-up.
